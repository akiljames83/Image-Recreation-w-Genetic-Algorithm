# Image-Recreation-w-Genetic-Algorithm

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the final project for my 2S03 - Programming in C Course. This project required us to create a **Genetic Algorithm** for the recreation of a given image starting from a randomly generated PPM image. To further improve the efficacy of this algorithm, we applied an **Exponentially Decaying Adaptive Learning Rate** to the Genetic Algorithm in order to further improve the accuracy of the model given the same original input parameters.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a better visualization of the algorithm refer to my personal website with the full video attached (http://akilhamilton.com) in the Evolutionary Image Modal.
