# Image-Recreation-w-Genetic-Algorithm

This was the final project for my 2S03 - Programming in C Course. This project required us to create a genetic algorithm for the recreation of a given image starting from a randomly generated PPM image.  
To further improve the efficacy of this algorithm, we applied an Exponentially Decaying Adaptive Learning Rate to the Genetic Algorithm in order to further improve the accuracy of the model given the same original input parameters. For a better visualization of the algorithm refer to my personal website with the full video attached (http://akilhamilton.com) in the Evolutionary Image Modal.
